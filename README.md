# My Home Server

`00-early` has the distilled info from [my original Gist](https://gist.github.com/airbreather/6b92b1515f1e3dcce02662d45c64500a), split out into steps and with some of the larger / more important heredocs extracted into files. This gets me to a point before going all-in on containers and stuff.

Beyond that, `01-services/install.zsh` installs everything else from its own subdirectory.
